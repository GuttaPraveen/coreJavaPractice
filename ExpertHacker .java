/*JFM1T9_Assignment2:
    Write a BankAccount class with members account_number and account_balance  and prevent other class objects 
    (assuming them as hackers who can steal your confidential information) to access BankAccount details.
    Steps to Follow:
    Step1: Create account_number and account_balance as member variables for BankAccount class
    Step 2: Add setter and getter methods for the above member variables 
    Prompt the user for the  values to be input from the terminal.

    Sample Input:
    Enter BankAccount Number : 6789023
    Enter Current Balance    : 67,000.89

    Expected Output:
    BankAccount Number : 6789023
    Current Balance    : 67000.89

class BankAccount { 
//declare account_number , aaccount_number

    System.out.println("Current Balance: "+obj.getAccount_Balance());
        
        

//Take input from user

//Create an object of BankAccount class and set account_number and the account_balance

// Try accessing fields of BankAcccount class and check whether it's accessible 

// or not. If not then try accessing it with itâ€™s setter and getter methods. 

// Print account_number and account_balance
